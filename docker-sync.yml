    # use this to change the exclude syntax.
    # Path: you match the exact path ( nesting problem )
    # Name: If a file or a folder does match this string ( solves nesting problem )
    # Regex: Define a regular expression
    # none: You can define a type for each sync exclude, so sync_excludes: ['Name .git', 'Path Gemlock']
